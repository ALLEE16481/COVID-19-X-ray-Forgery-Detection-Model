# COVID-19-X-ray-Forgery-Detection-Model
COVID-19 X-ray Forgery Detection Model is a deep learning project designed to detect tampered or forged chest X-ray images related to COVID-19. Manipulated medical images can degrade AI model performance and mislead diagnosis. This system uses convolutional neural networks (CNNs) with image processing techniques to identify common forgeries
